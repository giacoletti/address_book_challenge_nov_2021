# Address Book Challenge

Address Book challenge issued by Craft Academy on the 4th week of the preparatory course.

## Deployment

WIP

## Dependencies

- Node.js
- [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3474](http://localhost:3474) to view it in your browser.

### `yarn start:hot`

Starts the application as local server by running 'serve.js' file. [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/) is used along with [Superstatic](https://github.com/firebase/superstatic#readme) as middleware. 
http://localhost:3474 is automatically opened in your browser. Browsersync automatically refreshes the page everytime a file is modified and saved.

### `yarn cypress`

Runs the app with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), the next generation front end testing tool built for the modern web. We address the key pain points developers and QA engineers face when testing modern applications.

### `yarn test`

Unit tests are performed using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases.
We enrich Mocha with:
- [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) Assertion Library.
- [bdd-lazy-var](https://github.com/stalniy/bdd-lazy-var#readme)
- [Sinon.js](https://sinonjs.org/)
- [Sinon-Chai](https://github.com/domenic/sinon-chai#readme)
